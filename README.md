# GIS Virginia Parser Project - CS 3114

## Project Specification:
You will implement a system that indexes and provides search features for a file of GIS records, as described above.

Your system will build and maintain several in-memory index data structures to support these operations:
- Importing new GIS records into the database file
- Retrieving data for all GIS records matching given geographic coordinates
- Retrieving data for all GIS records matching a given feature name and state
- Retrieving data for all GIS records that fall within a given (rectangular) geographic region
- Displaying the in-memory indices in a human-readable manner

You will implement a single software system in Java to perform all system functions.
